This means that someone with 10 votes always votes with those 10 votes in every proposal. The problem with this is that it completely neglects the strength of preference the member has in their decision making. This is especially important for representing minority members. To create preference there needs to be a concept of scarcity with which members must make a tradeoff. The logical starting place for this is to create scarcity across multiple proposals within the system. The more you care about one proposal the less you are able to care about others. To achieve this Plural uses tokens. Tokens are accumulated predominantly based on the weight of the member. After every proposal a user earns its weight in tokens. When it comes to voting, a member not only picks the version but also the amount of tokens that they want to commit to it.
